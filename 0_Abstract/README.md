### Abstract of the project
In today's world, the usage of robotics in industries and vast technical applications has been shown to have a significant impact. 
Humans benefit substantially from the employment of autonomous systems and their excellent performance in hazardous conditions. 
Obstacle detection is regarded as the most important criterion for a self-driving vehicle. 
Obstacle avoidance is a self-driving vehicle that detects the existence of an object or an obstacle and avoids colliding with it, keeping both the robot and the surroundings safe.
To create an obstacle avoidance robot, you'll need the right sensors and motors for the job.
